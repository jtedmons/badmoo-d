        About Us </span> We are a small family owned and operated frozen yogurt (and maybe food) truck. We primarily
                    service the Sweetwater, TN area, but you may spot us in the surrounding areas as well. Location and
                    food options for the day can be found on our Facebook. We will also
                    be available for booking for private events so head over to the contact us page and send us the
                    information. We hope that you and your family enjoy our heavily themed menu items and stop by and
                    see us. And remember....</p>
                <p>
                    It's okay to not always be okay. Our goal with our frozen yogurt & toppings, desserts and
                    occasional homemade food is to turn your bad mood into a great mood, or at least make it a little
                    better
                </p>
