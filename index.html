                <h2>Who's in a Bad Moo'd?</h2>
                <p> <span class="intro">
        About Us </span> We are the Edmonsons. My name is Josh, and I am married to my beautiful wife, Destiny. Together
                    we have two kids, Ezra who is 11 and Mila who is 9. Me and my wife have been together for a total of
                    12
                    years
                    now. We have had a whirlwind of a life full of some lows and some really great highs.</p>
                <p>
                    Currently I work as a Business Analyst for Amazon. I have been with Amazon since 2014, where I
                    started
                    out as a warehouse worker, my work has taken us all over the country, and has finally allowed us to
                    have experiences that we could have never imagined being able to. My wife is currently a Customer
                    Service Lead at Old Navy, where she has been for about 6 months now.</p>
                <p>
                    Overall we're a pretty normal family who loves each other, loves to spend time together, and love to
                    try
                    new things and try to create as many memories as we can. The past few years we have finally got to a
                    place in our life where we've been able to take vacations and trips. We didn't even have our first
                    until 2018.</p>
                <p>
                    In our time having these experiences we've also come up with some tips and ideas that hopefully can
                    benefit other people that may be interested in visiting some of the places we've been. We also would
                    love
                    to receive suggestions for new places or things to try, or even some tips for places we've been that
                    we
                    may not
                    know about. We've also broken down our vacations and ranked them based on various experiences. We
                    hope
                    that you enjoy learning about or lives as much as we have enjoyed living, and hope to hear from you.
                    Don't be strangers!
